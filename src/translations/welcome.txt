Litewrite

Hey! Good to see you! :)

This is a distraction-free app designed for simple note taking and writing. It works offline and your browser will keep your data saved (nerd facts: AppCache & localStorage). You can also synchronize your notes to different devices using the open remoteStorage standard. Just check out the widget in the top right to get started.

And Litewrite is open source, meaning you can help make it better! If you have any problems or suggestions let us know at http://github.com/litewrite/litewrite/issues

Cool you’re here, hope you like it!

By the way, you can also use shortcuts to work more quickly:
- Alt + n: new note
- Alt + j: focus search field
- Alt + ↑: switch to note above
- Alt + ↓: switch to note below
(on Mac use Ctrl instead of Alt)
